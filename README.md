# Why did I make this?

Mostly to show that the following things could be done with vanilla JS, CSS and HTML

* Web components that aren't terribly difficult to wrangle

* Decent styling inside web components without a performance hit and a single source CSS file

* An alternative way of doing styling on a per component basis - referenced in code but not currently used

* Separatable logic of game (you can run the game logic in console if you wanted) vs UI

* Javascript animations that work really well and trigger proper events

* Efficient performance

* CSS variable usage for just about everything

* A different way of attacking responsiveness by using css variables to calculate ratios based on viewport size and adjust all elements accordingly (this should work on all devices, regardless of size, regardless of orientation, everything should fit in the screen)
